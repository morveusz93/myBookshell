Hi.
myBookshell is CRUD app created with express.js and mongoDB.
The look is simple, it is my first app with this stack so i have focused at make things working ;)

What can You do with myBookshell?
1. Add new book to bookshell
    -add title, author, choose a category, chceck if had you read this book already.
2. At the main look (/books) you can see added books. If book is to read its color is green, if you have read it already, the color is red.
3. Books' names are links, you can click at it and look at details about the book.
4. In details you can edit or delete the book.
